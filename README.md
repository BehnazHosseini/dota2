# Exploratory Data Analysis and Insight Extraction on DOTA 2 Data

## Overview

Welcome to the DOTA 2 Analysis project repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of various aspects of DOTA 2 gameplay using data analysis techniques. The analysis covers hero selection, team dynamics, match outcomes, attributes, buildings, experience, kills, deaths, assists, and more.

## Introduction

DOTA 2 (Defense of the Ancients 2) is a popular online action game developed by Valve Corporation. This project delves into the game's data to uncover insights and trends related to gameplay mechanics, hero attributes, match outcomes, and more. By analyzing key aspects of the game, this project provides valuable information for both novice and experienced DOTA 2 players.

## Project Phases

The project is divided into three main phases:

1. Phase 1 - Proposal Project proposal outlining the goals, motivations, and expectations.
2. Phase 2 - Data Collection: Data gathering, cleaning, and preliminary visualizations.
3. Phase 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis, conclusions, and insights drawn from the data.

## Analysis Highlights

Some of the key analysis highlights include:

- Examining the impact of hero picks and bans on match outcomes.
- Investigating the correlation between team attributes and match results.
- Analyzing building status and its influence on match results.
- Exploring the role of experience, kills, deaths, and assists in match outcomes.
- Developing a predictive model for match result forecasting.
- Providing practical tips and insights for DOTA 2 players.
